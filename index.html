    <h2>General</h2>
<p>My name is Brett, I'm a simple guy who likes to play video games and shoot pool.  Ocassionally I go for bike rides
and when I'm not super lazy I cook full meals and refuse to do the dishes till I absolutely have to.  I prefer to wear a
beard, but with my Corona hair I would look like a homeless person.</p>
    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>For the last 4 years, until the big Rona hit the world like a tidal wave, I worked as a product photographer and image
    editor.  The company I worked for sold vacuum pumps and fittings like the one below.  This is a 3d image I rendered to look as real as I possibly could
