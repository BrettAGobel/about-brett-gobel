    <h2>General</h2>
<p>Greetings. I am Brett Gobel, a developer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm a simple guy who likes to play video games and shoot pool. I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincidentally a graphic designer. The company I worked for sold vacuum pumps and fittings like the one below. This is a 3d image I rendered to look as real as I possibly could. I enjoy discovering new local food joints especially carne asada stuffed sopaipillas. I'm very proud of New Mexico and what other New Mexicans are doing here in Albuquerque, our red and green chilli is killer!
</p>
    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p> Join me on my journey into the wide world of professional development! I will chronicle the process of creating applications, add any new insights into the tech community in Albuquerque that I learn, and drop some mad links with the resources that I am using on my journey. If you have any questions or want to share your journey, feel free to message me using the contact page, or connect with me on social media.
    </p>
